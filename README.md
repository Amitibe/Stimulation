# Simulation
A basic simulation about some circles and their life cycle.


This simulation represents life in a specific environment.
These are the rules of nature in this environment:
1) Every "day" a new constant number of food items is created. 
2) If a creature doesn't eat food during that "day" it dies.
3) If a creature eats only one food item it survives.
4) If a creature eats two or more food items it reproduces.
5) The newborn creature is mutated and gets a random radius about its parent(50% to 150% of its size).
6) A creature's speed is determined by its radius(20/radius).
7) A creature's color is determined by its speed.
8) After several days the simulation is finished.

The purpose of the simulation is to see which gene is better to have in this environment, being big or being fast.
There is an addition of Hunters which have the same rules only they have to eat creatures.
